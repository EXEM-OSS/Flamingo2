== User Management

Flamingo provides the tool to add, alter, and delete users and groups. For group names in Linux and HDFS, Flamingo user names are applied.
Only the system administrator has the privileges to use the user management tool.

[WARNING]
If there is any remaining user in the group to be removed, the user will be assigned to the default group (e.g. OCE), and the group will be deleted. So the system administrator must make sure that there are no members left in the group before deleting.

==== Altering a Group

Select a group and click `Alter Group`. Note that the altered group information will be applied to all members of the group. So keep this in mind before altering group.

[NOTE]
Either the user is registered through the sign up page or manually added by the system administrator, the system administrator must approve the registration. Otherwise, the user will not be able to log in. The home directory in Linux and HDFS also must be approved by the system administrator before using.

While users on hold for approval, select a user and select `Approve User` from the menu.
